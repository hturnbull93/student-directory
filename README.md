# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
Running the directory will automatically load the default file (students.csv) if it exists in the same directory as the directory.rb file.

A file to load can be passed as a parameter.

```shell
ruby directory.rb some_student_data.csv
```
